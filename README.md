# Swift News App:

* This demo is built using MVVM architecture and use delegation design patten for message passing

* For Article list, I am using tableview with self sizing cells to display the news list. I have considered ‘title’ key for title and ‘thumbnail’ key for image. I also considered that if thumbnail width and height is not available than there is no image

* I have used SDWebImage for async image loading and caching and managed the dependancies using cocoapod.

* For details, I have used ‘selftext’ param to show article description and displayed it in textview. And used the thumbnail image for article image.

* pod files are included.
